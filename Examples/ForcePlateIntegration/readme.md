1) Identify the origin and frame of your force plates.
2) Identify a way to consistently place the checkerboard relative to the force plates. Black square at top left.
3) Measure from the checkerboard origin to force plate origin, expressed in checkerboard frame.

4) After running the example_integrate_forceplates.py, sanity check that forces align with kinematics using OpenSim.
a) load model file (.osim) that was downloaded from OpenCap into OpenSim (ensure there is not model offset by right clicking on it in the navigator and making Model Offset = 0 in all directions)
b) load inverse kinematics file downloaded from OpenCap
c) right click on the Motion in the Navigator, click 'Associate Motion Data,' and select the ground reaction forces (OpenCapData/MeasuredForces/<trial_name>/<trial_name>_syncd_forces.mot)
