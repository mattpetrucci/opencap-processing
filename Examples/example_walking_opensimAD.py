    This example shows how to run dynamic simulations of walking using
    data collected with OpenCap. The code uses OpenSimAD, a custom version
    of OpenSim that supports automatic differentiation (AD).

    This example is made of two sub-examples. The first one uses a torque-driven
    musculoskeletal model and the second one uses a muscle-driven
    musculoskeletal model. Please note that both examples are meant to
    demonstrate how to run dynamic simualtions and are not meant to be 
    biomechanically valid. We only made sure the simulations converged to
    solutions that were visually reasonable. You can find more examples of
    dynamic simulations using OpenSimAD in example_kinetics.py.
